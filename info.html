	<h1>How are stolen bikes reported?</h1>
<p>Buying a stolen bicycle is a crime encourages bike theft.  This tool
lets you check a bicycle’s serial number against the Canada-wide CPIC police
database to see if it has been reported as stolen.  If you suspect a bicycle is
stolen but the serial number doesn’t show up positive, this could be due to a
number of reasons:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>The theft could not have been reported.</li>
	<li>There is a delay from when a theft is reported to the serial number being added to the database.</li>
	<li>You could have entered the serial number incorrectly or missed a number.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Remember: if the price is too good to be true, it probably is stolen.</p>
