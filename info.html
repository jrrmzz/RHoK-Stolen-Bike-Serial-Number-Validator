    <hr/>
    <p>Buying a stolen bicycle is a crime and encourages bike theft.  This tool
    lets you check a bicycle’s serial number against the Canada-wide 
    <a href="http://www.cpic-cipc.ca/English/index.cfm">CPIC police database</a>
    to see if it has been reported as stolen.  Not only do you avoid buying a stolen
    bike, but you also help deter bike thieves from selling stolen goods if they
    know they are more likely to be caught.</p>
    <p>If you suspect a bicycle is stolen but the serial number doesn’t show up 
    positive, this could be due to a number of reasons:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The theft could not have been reported.</li>
      <li>There is a delay from when a theft is reported to the serial number 
          being added to the database.</li>
      <li>You could have entered the serial number incorrectly or missed a number.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p>Remember: if the price is too good to be true, it probably is stolen.</p>
    
    <h2>When should I use this tool?</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>If you are thinking of buying a used bicycle, ask the seller to check 
        the stolen status of the bike, and use this tool to check whether the 
        bike is stolen.</p>

    <h2 id="mybikestolen">My bike was stolen!</h2>

    <p>If you come across a bike that is reported as stolen, <strong>do not buy the 
        bike!</strong>  Tell the seller you're not interested in the bike, and report
        some information about the bike and a description of the seller to the Police:
    </p>
