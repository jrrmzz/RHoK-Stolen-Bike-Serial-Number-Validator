	<h1>How are stolen bikes reported?</h1>
    <p>Buying a stolen bicycle is a crime encourages bike theft.  This tool
    lets you check a bicycle’s serial number against the Canada-wide CPIC police
    database to see if it has been reported as stolen.</p>
    <p>If you suspect a bicycle is stolen but the serial number doesn’t show up 
    positive, this could be due to a number of reasons:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>The theft could not have been reported.</li>
        <li>There is a delay from when a theft is reported to the serial number 
            being added to the database.</li>
        <li>You could have entered the serial number incorrectly or missed a number.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Remember: if the price is too good to be true, it probably is stolen.</p>

    <h1>When should I use this tool?</h1>
    <p>If you are thinking of buying a used bicycle, ask the seller to check 
        the stolen status of the bike, and use this tool to check whether the 
        bike is stolen.</p>
